Description: Multiple cluster location and detection for 2D and 3D spatial point patterns (case event data). The methodology of this package is based on an original method that allows the detection of multiple clusters of any shape. A selection order and the distance from its nearest neighbour once pre-selected points have been taken into account are attributed at each point. This distance is weighted by the expected distance under the uniform distribution hypothesis. Potential clusters are located by modelling the multiple structural change of the distances on the selection order. Their presence is tested using the double maximum test and a Monte Carlo procedure. The main function of this R package is "clus".
